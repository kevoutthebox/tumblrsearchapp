#Tumblr Search App.

I built it on Angular.

To use it just run the HTML file located in the public folder.

This project is currently only client side and does not have CORS enabled. To bypass this, you can use the chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en
